# Mol Mall Design

> **Status: Vision document** — Phase 1 (local formulas) exists. Phases 2-5 (registry, publishing, federation) are not implemented.

> A marketplace for Gas Town formulas

## Vision

**Mol Mall** is a registry for sharing formulas across Gas Town installations. Think npm for molecules, or Terraform Registry for workflows.

```
"Cook a formula, sling it to a polecat, the witness watches, refinery merges."

What if you could browse a mall of formulas, install one, and immediately
have your polecats executing world-class workflows?
```

### The Network Effect

A well-designed formula for "code review" or "security audit" or "deploy to K8s" can spread across thousands of Gas Town installations. Each adoption means:
- More agents executing proven workflows
- More structured, trackable work output
- Better capability routing (agents with track records on a formula get similar work)

## Architecture

## Formula Package Format

### Simple Case: Single File

Most formulas are single `.formula.toml` files:

```bash
gt formula install mol-polecat-code-review
# Downloads mol-polecat-code-review.formula.toml to ~/gt/.beads/formulas/
```

### Complex Case: Formula Bundle

Some formulas need supporting files (scripts, templates, configs):

```
mol-deploy-k8s.formula.bundle/
├── formula.toml              # Main formula
├── templates/
│   ├── deployment.yaml.tmpl
│   └── service.yaml.tmpl
├── scripts/
│   └── healthcheck.sh
└── README.md
```

Bundle format:
```bash
# Bundles are tarballs
mol-deploy-k8s-1.0.0.bundle.tar.gz
```

Installation:
```bash
gt formula install mol-deploy-k8s
# Extracts to ~/gt/.beads/formulas/mol-deploy-k8s/
# formula.toml is at mol-deploy-k8s/formula.toml
```

## Capability Tagging

### Formula Capability Declaration

```toml
[formula.capabilities]
# What capabilities does this formula exercise? Used for agent routing.
primary = ["go", "testing", "code-review"]
secondary = ["git", "ci-cd"]

# Capability weights (optional, for fine-grained routing)
[formula.capabilities.weights]
go = 0.3           # 30% of formula work is Go
testing = 0.4      # 40% is testing
code-review = 0.3  # 30% is code review
```

### Capability-Based Search

```bash
$ gt formula search --capabilities="security,go"

Formulas matching capabilities: security, go

  mol-security-audit           v2.1.0   ⭐ 4.8   📥 8,234
    Capabilities: security, go, code-review
    "Comprehensive security audit workflow"

  mol-dependency-scan          v1.0.0   ⭐ 4.2   📥 3,102
    Capabilities: security, go, supply-chain
    "Scan Go dependencies for vulnerabilities"
```

### Agent Accountability

When a polecat completes a formula, the execution is tracked:

```
Polecat: beads/amber
Formula: mol-polecat-code-review@1.3.0
Completed: 2026-01-10T15:30:00Z
Capabilities exercised:
  - code-review (primary)
  - security (secondary)
  - go (secondary)
```

This execution record enables:
1. **Routing** - Agents with successful track records get similar work
2. **Debugging** - Trace which agent did what, when
3. **Quality metrics** - Track success rates by agent and formula

## Private Registries

### Enterprise Deployment

```yaml
# ~/.gtconfig.yaml
registries:
  - name: acme
    url: https://molmall.acme.corp
    auth: token
    priority: 1  # Check first

  - name: public
    url: https://molmall.gastown.io
    auth: none
    priority: 2  # Fallback
```

### Self-Hosted Registry

```bash
# Docker deployment
docker run -d \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v /data/formulas:/formulas \
  -e AUTH_PROVIDER=oidc \
  gastown/molmall-registry:latest

# Configuration
MOLMALL_STORAGE=s3://bucket/formulas
MOLMALL_AUTH=oidc
MOLMALL_OIDC_ISSUER=https://auth.acme.corp
```

## Federation

Federation enables formula sharing across organizations using the Highway Operations Protocol (HOP).

### Cross-Registry Discovery

```bash
$ gt formula search "deploy kubernetes" --federated

Searching across federated registries...

  molmall.gastown.io:
    mol-deploy-k8s           v3.0.0   🏛️ Official

  molmall.acme.corp:
    @acme/mol-deploy-k8s     v2.1.0   ✓ Verified

  molmall.bigco.io:
    @bigco/k8s-workflow      v1.0.0   ⚠️ Unverified
```

### HOP URI Resolution

The `hop://` URI scheme provides cross-registry entity references:

```bash
# Full HOP URI
gt formula install hop://molmall.acme.corp/formulas/@acme/mol-deploy@2.1.0

# Resolution via HOP (Highway Operations Protocol)
1. Parse hop:// URI
2. Resolve registry endpoint (DNS/HOP discovery)
3. Authenticate (if required)
4. Download formula
5. Verify checksum/signature
6. Install to town-level
```

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Local Commands (Now)

See [Formula Resolution](formula-resolution.md) for the implemented three-tier resolution system.

### Phase 2: Manual Sharing

- Formula export/import
- `gt formula export mol-polecat-work > mol-polecat-work.formula.toml`
- `gt formula import < mol-polecat-work.formula.toml`
- Lock file format

### Phase 3: Public Registry

- molmall.gastown.io launch
- `gt formula install` from registry
- `gt formula publish` flow
- Basic search and browse

### Phase 4: Enterprise Features

- Private registry support
- Authentication integration
- Verification levels
- Audit logging

### Phase 5: Federation (HOP)

- Capability tags in schema
- Federation protocol (Highway Operations Protocol)
- Cross-registry search
- Agent execution tracking for accountability
